# Brief

In this project, we're creating a Pomodoro timer.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this might be a great way to push yourself.

**Users should be able to:**

- Start the timer by clicking on the start link/button.
- Once the user clicks start, the word start will change to stop. Then, the user can click on the stop button to make the timer stop.
- Click on the gear icon to change the length (minutes and seconds) of the timer.
- Once the timer finishes, the ring should change from green to red and an alert message is passed to the browser.

# Getting Started

1. To get started, [download the files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aWwdyu8hoZ-WcAV4UJZNmtEP_pND8929?usp=sharing). This includes all the project assets you need to get started: a creative brief, a Figma file with the designs, fonts, and images.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. If you don't have a Figma account, don't worry, [you can set one up for free.](http://figma.com)
3. Open the project's `README.md` file (that's this!). It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project / file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
6. Once you're finished, share your work using **#adventofcss**

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework or library like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
- Add interactivity to this project by writing out the JavaScript yourself. If you get stuck, you can always purchase the [Advent of JavaScript solutions](http://adventofjs.com), where James explains how to build this.

# FAQs

- Can I use libraries / frameworks on these projects?
    - Of course! We're providing the design files, but you can use whatever tools and frameworks you'd like.
- Oh no! I'm stuck!
    - Consider [purchasing the Solutions](http://adventofcss.com) (if you haven't already). You'll get access to a video, where James explains how to write all the code.
    - Check out the [Learn Build Teach Discord.](http://learnbuildteach.com) We have a specific channel set up, just for the Advent of JavaScript.
- Can I use this project in my portfolio?
    - Sure! But, be honest about the work that *you* did

    # Here's what I did:

    First I set up my project file structure, downloaded the files needed for this project read through everything and then opened the files within Figma so that I can have a look at the files while working. 

    I installed Sass within my terminal via node:
    
    ```
    npm install -g sass
    ```
    What is a CSS preprocessor?
    What we write in Sass needs to be compiled into CSS.

    I also installed the Live Sass Compiler extension by Glenn Marks. [glenn2223.live-sass]

    To begin using Sass I updated my css file from style.css to style.scss.

    Installed our package.json file to install our node packages.

    ```
    npm init -y
    ```
    Installed package-lock.json file by installing node into file

    ```
    npm install
    ```
